| `agent_in_use` | Agent has active calls and cannot be deleted |
| `unauthorized` | You don't have permission to delete this agent |

## Best Practices

Before deleting an agent:

1. **Check for active calls** - Ensure no calls are currently in progress
2. **Export configuration** - Save the agent's system prompt and settings if you might need them later
3. **Update integrations** - Remove references to this agent from webhooks and automations
