<RequestExample>

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch(
  'https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/webhooks/wh_abc123',
  {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    },
  }
);

const result = await response.json();
// { id: 'wh_abc123', deleted: true }
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.delete(
    'https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/webhooks/wh_abc123',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}
)

result = response.json()
# {'id': 'wh_abc123', 'deleted': True}
```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json 200 - Success
{
  "id": "wh_abc123",
  "deleted": true
}
```

```json 404 - Not Found
{
  "error": {
    "code": "webhook_not_found",
    "message": "The specified webhook does not exist"
  }
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `webhook_not_found` | The specified webhook_id does not exist |
| `unauthorized` | You don't have permission to delete this webhook |

## Alternative: Disable Instead

Instead of deleting, you can disable a webhook by updating its status:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/webhooks/wh_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "inactive"}'
```

This preserves the webhook configuration so you can re-enable it later.
