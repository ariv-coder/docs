# API Keys

API keys let you interact with the Ringyo AI API programmatically. Available on **Pro** and **Agency** plans.

## Generating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Developers">
    Navigate to **Dashboard → Developers → API Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new key">
    Click **Create API Key** and provide:
    - **Name** — a descriptive label (e.g., "Production Server", "Staging")
    - **Permissions** — choose which resources the key can access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy your key">
    Your API key will be displayed once. Copy and store it securely.
    <Warning>The full API key is only shown at creation. If you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Format

API keys follow this format:

```
rg_live_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsT...
rg_test_aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsT...
```

- `rg_live_` — production keys that make real calls and consume credits
- `rg_test_` — test keys for development (no real calls, no credit usage)

## Using Your API Key

Include the key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.ringyo.ai/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rg_live_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

See the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for full documentation.

## Permissions

When creating a key, you can scope it to specific resources:

| Permission | Access |
|-----------|--------|
| **Agents** | Create, read, update, delete agents |
| **Calls** | Initiate calls, read call logs |
| **Phone Numbers** | List and manage phone numbers |
| **Webhooks** | Manage webhook endpoints |
| **Read Only** | View data without making changes |

<Tip>Follow the principle of least privilege. Only grant permissions each key actually needs.</Tip>

## Managing Keys

From **Dashboard → Developers → API Keys**, you can:

- **View** — see all active keys with last used timestamps
- **Rename** — update the key name or description
- **Revoke** — permanently disable a key (cannot be undone)
- **Regenerate** — create a new key and disable the old one

## Rate Limits

| Plan | Rate Limit |
|------|-----------|
| Pro | 60 requests/minute |
| Agency | 300 requests/minute |

Exceeding the limit returns `429 Too Many Requests`. Implement exponential backoff in your integration.

## Security Best Practices

- **Never expose keys in client-side code** — only use them server-side
- **Use environment variables** — don't hardcode keys in source code
- **Rotate regularly** — regenerate keys periodically
- **Use test keys for development** — avoid spending credits during testing

<Info>If you suspect a key has been compromised, revoke it immediately from the dashboard.</Info>
