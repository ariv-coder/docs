# Quick Start Guide

This guide walks you through setting up your first AI voice agent on Ringyo AI — from sign-up to a live agent handling calls.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A Ringyo account ([Sign up](https://www.ringyo.ai/sign-up))
- A few minutes to configure your agent

<Info>
  Every new account gets a **14-day free trial** with 500 credits — no credit card required.
</Info>

## Step 1: Create Your Business

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your Dashboard">
    Go to your [Dashboard](https://www.ringyo.ai/dashboard) and complete the onboarding flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your business profile">
    Navigate to **Settings → Business** and fill in your business name, category, contact info, and working hours. Your AI agent uses this info to answer caller questions accurately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create a Voice Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Agents">
    Go to **Dashboard → Agents** and click **Create Agent**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your agent">
    - **Name**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Front Desk Agent")
    - **Voice**: Choose from available voices and preview them
    - **Greeting**: Write the first thing your agent says (e.g., "Hello! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?")
    - **Instructions**: Tell the agent how to behave, what services to offer, and when to transfer to a human
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and activate">
    Click **Save**, then toggle the agent to **Active**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Train Your Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Knowledge Base">
    Go to **Dashboard → Knowledge Base** and click **Add Entry**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add FAQs and service info">
    Add entries your agent should know — business hours, services, pricing, policies, directions, etc. The more you add, the better your agent handles questions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Connect a Phone Number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Phone Numbers">
    Navigate to **Dashboard → Phone Numbers** and click **Add Number**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Buy or connect a number">
    Purchase a new number through Ringyo or connect an existing Twilio number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to your agent">
    Select your voice agent to handle calls on this number.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  Your AI agent is now live! Calls to your number will be answered by your voice agent.
</Check>

## Step 5: Test Your Agent

Click **Test Call** on the agent page — Ringyo will call your phone so you can interact with your agent and fine-tune its behavior.

## Using the API (Optional)

For developers who want to integrate programmatically, Ringyo provides a REST API. You'll need a **Pro or Agency plan** for API access.

### Get Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Developer Section">
    Navigate to your [Dashboard](https://www.ringyo.ai/dashboard) and click on **Developers** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API Key">
    Click **Create Key**, give it a name, select permissions, and click **Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Your Key">
    <Warning>
      Your API key will only be shown once. Copy it and store it securely.
    </Warning>
    The key will look like: `vb_live_ABC123xyz...`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an Agent via API

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/agents \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vb_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sarah - Receptionist",
    "voice_id": "sarah",
    "personality": "friendly and professional",
    "greeting": "Hello! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?"
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/agents', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer vb_live_YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Sarah - Receptionist',
    voice_id: 'sarah',
    personality: 'friendly and professional',
    greeting: 'Hello! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?'
  })
});

const agent = await response.json();
console.log('Agent created:', agent.id);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/agents',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer vb_live_YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'name': 'Sarah - Receptionist',
        'voice_id': 'sarah',
        'personality': 'friendly and professional',
        'greeting': 'Hello! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?'
    }
)

agent = response.json()
print(f"Agent created: {agent['id']}")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Calls API

<Warning>
  API access to calls is coming soon. The calls endpoints (`/api/v1/calls`) currently return `501 Not Implemented`. For now, use the dashboard to manage calls and view call history. Agent, webhook, and other endpoints are fully functional.
</Warning>

### Set Up Webhooks

Receive real-time updates when calls complete:

```bash
curl https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/webhooks \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vb_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
    "events": ["call.completed", "call.failed"]
  }'
```
