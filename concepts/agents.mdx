# Voice Agents

Voice agents are the AI-powered assistants that handle your phone calls. Each agent has its own voice, personality, and capabilities.

## What is a Voice Agent?

A voice agent is an AI that can:

- **Speak** in a natural, human-like voice
- **Listen** and understand what callers say
- **Respond** intelligently based on context
- **Take actions** like booking appointments or transferring calls
- **Learn** from your knowledge base to answer questions

## Creating an Agent

You can create agents via the Dashboard or API:

### Via Dashboard

1. Go to **Dashboard → Voice Agents**
2. Click **Create Agent**
3. Configure voice, personality, and capabilities
4. Click **Create**

### Via API

```bash
curl https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/agents \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vb_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sarah - Receptionist",
    "voice_id": "sarah",
    "personality": "friendly, professional, helpful",
    "greeting": "Hello! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?",
    "language": "en-US"
  }'
```

## Configuration Options

### Voice

Choose from multiple voices:

| Voice ID | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `sarah` | Sarah | Warm, professional female |
| `james` | James | Confident male voice |
| `emma` | Emma | Friendly, upbeat female |
| `michael` | Michael | Deep, authoritative male |
| `aria` | Aria | Youthful, energetic female |

### Personality

Describe how your agent should behave:

```json
{
  "personality": "friendly and professional, speaks clearly, uses the caller's name, stays on topic"
}
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific about tone (formal, casual, friendly)
- Define boundaries (what NOT to discuss)
- Include industry-specific instructions

### Greeting

The first thing your agent says:

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello! Thanks for calling Acme Dental. This is Sarah speaking. How can I help you today?"
}
```

### Fallback Message

When the agent can't understand or help:

```json
{
  "fallback_message": "I apologize, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat that?"
}
```

### Transfer Settings

Configure when and how to transfer to humans:

```json
{
  "transfer_enabled": true,
  "transfer_number": "+1234567890",
  "transfer_triggers": ["speak to human", "talk to someone", "representative"]
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Voice Settings

Fine-tune the voice output:

```json
{
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.7,
    "similarity_boost": 0.8,
    "style": 0.5,
    "use_speaker_boost": true
  }
}
```

| Setting | Description | Range |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `stability` | Voice consistency (higher = more stable) | 0-1 |
| `similarity_boost` | How close to original voice | 0-1 |
| `style` | Expressiveness level | 0-1 |

### Language

Set the agent's language:

```json
{
  "language": "en-US",
  "auto_detect_language": false
}
```

Supported languages:
- `en-US` - English (US)
- `en-GB` - English (UK)
- `es-ES` - Spanish (Spain)
- `es-MX` - Spanish (Mexico)
- `fr-FR` - French
- `de-DE` - German
- More coming soon!

### Call Duration

Set maximum call length:

```json
{
  "max_call_duration": 600
}
```

## Knowledge Base

Connect your knowledge base to give the agent information:

1. Go to **Dashboard → Knowledge Base**
2. Add FAQs, service info, policies
3. The agent will use this to answer questions

Example knowledge base entries:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "faq",
    "question": "What are your hours?",
    "answer": "We're open Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM."
  },
  {
    "type": "service",
    "content": "Our dental cleaning service costs $150 and takes about 45 minutes."
  }
]
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep greetings short">
    Long greetings frustrate callers. Get to the point quickly.
    
    ✅ "Hello, this is Sarah from Acme Dental. How can I help?"
    
    ❌ "Hello and welcome to Acme Dental, the premier dental care provider in the greater metropolitan area since 1985..."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test your agent">
    Use the test call feature in the dashboard to refine your agent before going live.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Build a comprehensive knowledge base">
    The more information your agent has, the better it can help callers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set up human transfer">
    Always have a way for callers to reach a human for complex issues.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Status: Draft vs Published

Agents have two states:

- **Draft**: Can be tested but won't receive real calls
- **Published**: Live and receiving calls

Only publish an agent when you're confident it's ready.
