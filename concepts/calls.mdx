# Calls

Ringyo AI can handle both inbound and outbound phone calls. This guide covers how calls work and how to manage them.

## Call Types

### Inbound Calls

When someone calls your Ringyo AI phone number:

1. Call is answered by your voice agent
2. Agent greets the caller
3. Conversation happens naturally
4. Agent can book appointments, answer questions, or transfer
5. Call ends and you receive a webhook with details

### Outbound Calls

Make calls programmatically via API:

```bash
curl https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/calls \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vb_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "+1234567890",
    "agent_id": "agent_xyz",
    "context": {
      "customer_name": "John Smith",
      "purpose": "appointment_reminder",
      "appointment_date": "January 20th at 2 PM"
    }
  }'
```

## Call Context

Pass context to personalize the conversation:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "customer_name": "John Smith",
    "customer_type": "returning",
    "last_visit": "December 15th",
    "purpose": "follow_up",
    "notes": "Interested in teeth whitening"
  }
}
```

Your agent can use this context naturally:

> "Hello John! I'm following up on your visit in December. I remember you were interested in our teeth whitening services..."

## Call Lifecycle

```
initiated → ringing → answered → in_progress → completed
                                             → transferred
                         → no_answer
                         → busy
                         → failed
```

### States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `initiated` | Call started, dialing |
| `ringing` | Phone is ringing |
| `answered` | Call connected |
| `in_progress` | Conversation happening |
| `completed` | Call ended normally |
| `transferred` | Transferred to human |
| `no_answer` | No answer after timeout |
| `busy` | Line busy |
| `failed` | Technical failure |

## Call Results

After a call ends, you get detailed results:

```json
{
  "call_id": "call_abc123",
  "status": "completed",
  "duration_seconds": 145,
  "outcome": "appointment_booked",
  "transcript": "Agent: Hello! Thanks for calling...\nCustomer: Hi, I'd like to book...",
  "recording_url": "https://...",
  "extracted_data": {
    "appointment_date": "2024-01-20",
    "appointment_time": "14:00",
    "service": "dental_cleaning"
  },
  "sentiment": {
    "overall": "positive",
    "score": 0.85
  }
}
```

### Outcomes

Common call outcomes:

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `appointment_booked` | Successfully booked appointment |
| `information_provided` | Answered caller's questions |
| `callback_requested` | Caller wants a callback |
| `transferred` | Transferred to human |
| `voicemail_left` | Left voicemail |
| `no_action` | Call ended without action |

## Transcripts

Every call generates a transcript:

```
[00:00] Agent: Hello! Thanks for calling Acme Dental. This is Sarah. How can I help you today?

[00:05] Customer: Hi Sarah, I'd like to schedule a cleaning appointment.

[00:08] Agent: I'd be happy to help you schedule that! What day works best for you?

[00:12] Customer: Do you have anything available next Tuesday afternoon?

[00:15] Agent: Let me check... Yes! I have 2 PM and 3:30 PM available next Tuesday. Which would you prefer?
```

## Recordings

Calls are recorded by default (can be disabled). Access recordings:

```bash
curl https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/calls/call_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vb_live_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response includes `recording_url` for the audio file.

<Warning>
  Ensure you comply with call recording laws in your jurisdiction. Some regions require two-party consent.
</Warning>

## Bulk Calls (Campaigns)

Make multiple calls with a campaign:

```bash
curl https://www.ringyo.ai/api/v1/campaigns \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vb_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Appointment Reminders",
    "agent_id": "agent_xyz",
    "contacts": [
      {"phone": "+1234567890", "context": {"name": "John", "appointment": "Monday 2pm"}},
      {"phone": "+0987654321", "context": {"name": "Jane", "appointment": "Monday 3pm"}}
    ],
    "settings": {
      "max_concurrent": 5,
      "retry_no_answer": true,
      "schedule": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z"
    }
  }'
```

## Handling Transfer

When a caller asks to speak to a human:

1. Agent acknowledges the request
2. Plays hold music/message
3. Dials your transfer number
4. Connects caller to human
5. Webhook sent with `transferred` status

Configure transfer settings:

```json
{
  "transfer_enabled": true,
  "transfer_number": "+1234567890",
  "transfer_message": "One moment while I connect you with a team member."
}
```

## Pricing

Calls are billed based on duration:

- Outbound calls: Charged per minute connected
- Inbound calls: Charged per minute connected
- Credits deducted from your balance

Check your usage in **Dashboard → Billing**.

## Post-Call Satisfaction Survey

Ringyo AI can collect caller feedback at the end of each call using a DTMF (touch-tone) survey.

### How It Works

1. After the conversation ends, the agent asks: *"Before you go, how would you rate this call? Press 1 for poor, 2 for okay, or 3 for great."*
2. Caller presses a key on their phone
3. Rating is recorded and visible in analytics

### Rating Scale

| Key Press | Rating | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Poor | 1-2 |
| 2 | Okay | 3 |
| 3 | Great | 4-5 |

### Enabling Surveys

1. Go to **Settings → Voice Agent → Post-Call Survey**
2. Toggle **Enable satisfaction survey**
3. Optionally customize the survey prompt

### Viewing Results

Satisfaction scores appear in multiple places:

- **Call details** — Individual call pages show the rating
- **Analytics → Calls** — Average satisfaction and distribution charts
- **Webhooks** — `satisfaction_score` included in `call.completed` payload

```json
{
  "event": "call.completed",
  "data": {
    "call_id": "call_abc123",
    "satisfaction_score": 5,
    "satisfaction_response": "great",
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

<Info>
  Calls where the customer hangs up before the survey show `satisfaction_score: null`.
</Info>

## Best Practices

1. **Test before bulk calling** — Make test calls to verify agent behavior
2. **Respect calling hours** — Don't call late at night or early morning
3. **Include context** — Personalized calls are more effective
4. **Handle failures** — Set up retry logic for no-answers
5. **Monitor outcomes** — Use webhooks to track results
6. **Review low-rated calls** — Listen to recordings of 1-2 star calls to improve

- [n8n Integration](/integrations/n8n) for automation
