# Credits

Credits are the usage currency in Ringyo AI. Every interaction your agent has consumes credits based on the type of action.

## Credit Costs

| Action | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| 1 chat message sent/received | 1 |
| 1 minute of voice call | 5 |
| 1 knowledge base entry added | 2 |
| 1 appointment booked | 1 |

### Examples

- A 3-minute phone call = **15 credits** (3 × 5)
- A chat with 8 messages = **8 credits** (8 × 1)
- Adding 10 FAQ entries = **20 credits** (10 × 2)
- Booking an appointment during a 2-min call = **11 credits** (10 + 1)

## Monthly Allocation

Each plan includes a monthly credit balance:

| Plan | Monthly Credits | Price |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Starter | 500 | $29/mo |
| Pro | 2,000 | $79/mo |
| Agency | 10,000 | $199/mo |

<Warning>Credits reset on your billing date each month. Unused credits do **not** roll over to the next month.</Warning>

## Checking Your Balance

You can see your current credit balance in multiple places:

- **Dashboard home** — top-right corner
- **Analytics → Credit Usage** — detailed breakdown
- **Settings → Billing** — alongside your plan details

## Running Low on Credits

When your balance gets low, you have two options:

### 1. Purchase Add-On Credits

Buy extra credits without changing your plan:

| Pack | Credits | Price |
|------|---------|-------|
| Small | 250 | $15 |
| Medium | 1,000 | $49 |
| Large | 5,000 | $199 |

Go to **Settings → Billing → Buy Credits** to purchase. Add-on credits are available immediately and expire at your next billing date.

### 2. Upgrade Your Plan

If you consistently need more credits, [upgrading your plan](/guides/plans-and-billing) is more cost-effective.

## Low Credit Alerts

Set up notifications so you never run out unexpectedly:

1. Go to **Settings → Notifications**
2. Enable **Low Credit Alert**
3. Set your threshold (e.g., 50 credits remaining)

You'll receive an email and dashboard notification when your balance drops below the threshold.

<Tip>Monitor your credit usage in **Analytics** to predict when you'll run out and plan accordingly.</Tip>

## What Happens at Zero Credits?

When your credits reach zero:

- Your agents **stop handling** new calls and chats
- Existing conversations in progress are completed
- Appointments already booked are not affected
- You can still access the dashboard, analytics, and settings

<Info>Purchase add-on credits or wait for your monthly reset to restore service.</Info>
