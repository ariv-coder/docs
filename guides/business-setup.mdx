# Business Setup

Setting up your business profile helps your AI agent provide accurate information to callers and visitors. Complete this before creating your first agent.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Business Settings">
    Navigate to **Dashboard → Settings → Business**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add business details">
    Fill in the following:
    - **Business Name** — your company or brand name
    - **Category** — select from options like Healthcare, Real Estate, Restaurant, Salon, Legal, etc.
    - **Description** — a brief summary of what your business does (used by the AI for context)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set contact information">
    Add your:
    - **Phone number** — your main business line
    - **Email** — customer-facing email
    - **Address** — physical location (if applicable)
    - **Website** — your business website URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure working hours">
    Set your operating hours for each day of the week. The AI uses this to:
    - Inform callers if you're open or closed
    - Schedule appointments within available hours
    - Handle after-hours calls differently (if configured)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Click **Save** to apply your business profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working Hours

<Info>Working hours are used by the appointment system and your AI agent. Callers outside business hours will hear a custom after-hours message if configured.</Info>

You can set different hours for each day, or mark days as closed. Common setups:

- **Standard:** Mon–Fri 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM
- **Extended:** Mon–Sat 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM
- **Custom:** Different hours per day
