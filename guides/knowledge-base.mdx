# Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is how you train your AI agent. The more accurate info you provide, the better your agent handles customer questions.

## Adding Knowledge

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Knowledge Base">
    Navigate to **Dashboard → Knowledge Base**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose entry type">
    Click **Add Entry** and select a type:
    - **FAQ** — a question and answer pair
    - **Service** — description of a service you offer
    - **Policy** — business rules (cancellation, refund, etc.)
    - **General Info** — hours, location, parking, directions, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the content">
    Provide clear, conversational content. Write answers the way you'd want your agent to say them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. The entry is immediately available to your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>Each knowledge base entry costs **2 credits** when created. There's no ongoing cost — the agent references it for free after that.</Info>

## FAQ Examples

Good FAQ entries are specific and conversational:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What are your hours? | We're open Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM, and Saturdays 10 AM to 2 PM. We're closed on Sundays. |
| Do you accept insurance? | Yes, we accept most major insurance plans including Aetna, Blue Cross, and United. Please bring your insurance card to your appointment. |
| Where are you located? | We're at 123 Main Street, Suite 200, right across from City Park. Free parking is available in the lot behind our building. |

<Tip>Write answers in a natural, friendly tone. Your agent will use them as-is when responding to callers.</Tip>

## Services

For each service you offer, include:
- **Name** — e.g., "Teeth Cleaning"
- **Description** — what it includes
- **Duration** — how long it takes
- **Price** (optional) — cost or price range

## Bulk Import

Have a lot of entries? Use the **Import** feature to upload a CSV file:

```csv
type,question,answer
faq,What are your hours?,Mon-Fri 9-5 and Sat 10-2
faq,Do you take walk-ins?,Yes we accept walk-ins based on availability
service,Teeth Cleaning,Professional cleaning takes about 45 minutes. $120.
```

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** — "We're at 123 Main St" is better than "See our website"
- **Keep it current** — update entries when prices, hours, or policies change
- **Cover common questions** — think about what customers ask most often
- **Add edge cases** — what should the agent say if someone asks about something you don't offer?

<Warning>Outdated knowledge base entries can lead to your agent giving incorrect information. Review entries regularly.</Warning>
