# Phone Numbers

Your AI agent needs a phone number to make and receive calls. Ringyo AI integrates with Twilio for phone number provisioning.

## Getting a Phone Number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Phone Numbers">
    Navigate to **Dashboard → Phone Numbers** and click **Add Number**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your method">
    You have two options:
    - **Buy a new number** — purchase a number directly through Ringyo (powered by Twilio)
    - **Connect existing** — link a Twilio number you already own
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your number">
    If buying new, choose your preferred:
    - **Country** — US, UK, Canada, and more
    - **Area code** — search by region or city
    - **Number type** — local, toll-free, or mobile
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to an agent">
    Select which voice agent should handle calls on this number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate">
    Click **Activate** and your number is live. Calls to this number will be answered by your AI agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connecting an Existing Twilio Number

If you already have a Twilio account with phone numbers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Twilio credentials">
    From your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com), copy your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect in Ringyo">
    Go to **Dashboard → Phone Numbers → Connect Existing** and paste your credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select numbers">
    Ringyo will display your available Twilio numbers. Select the ones you want to use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Connecting an existing number will update its webhook configuration in Twilio. If you're using the number elsewhere, it will stop receiving calls there.</Warning>

## Number Limits

Each plan has a limit on phone numbers:

| Plan | Numbers Included |
|------|-----------------|
| Starter | 1 |
| Pro | 3 |
| Agency | 10 |

<Info>Need more numbers? Contact support at **support@ringyo.ai** for custom limits.</Info>

## Managing Numbers

From the Phone Numbers page you can:

- **Reassign** — move a number to a different agent
- **Disable** — temporarily stop the agent from answering (calls go to voicemail)
- **Release** — remove the number from your account

## Number Costs

Phone numbers purchased through Ringyo are included in your plan. Twilio carrier charges (if any) are handled automatically.
