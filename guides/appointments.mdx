# Appointments

Let your AI agent book appointments for you automatically. Customers can schedule during calls or chat — no human intervention needed.

## Setting Up Appointments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable appointments">
    Go to **Dashboard → Appointments → Settings** and toggle **Enable Appointment Booking**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure services">
    Add the services customers can book:
    - **Service name** — e.g., "Consultation", "Teeth Cleaning"
    - **Duration** — 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes
    - **Description** — brief info shown to customers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set available time slots">
    Define your availability:
    - Choose available days and hours
    - Set buffer time between appointments (e.g., 15 minutes)
    - Block off lunch breaks or unavailable times
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect a calendar (optional)">
    Sync with your existing calendar to avoid double-bookings:
    - **Google Calendar**
    - **Microsoft Outlook**
    
    Go to **Appointments → Settings → Calendar Integration** and click **Connect**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and test">
    Save your settings, then test by asking your agent to book an appointment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

When a customer wants to book during a call or chat:

1. The agent asks what service they need
2. Offers available time slots based on your schedule
3. Collects customer details (name, phone, email)
4. Confirms the booking and sends a confirmation
5. The appointment appears in your dashboard and connected calendar

<Info>Each appointment booked costs **1 credit**.</Info>

## Managing Appointments

From **Dashboard → Appointments**, you can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **View** | See all upcoming and past appointments |
| **Reschedule** | Change the date/time of an existing booking |
| **Cancel** | Cancel an appointment (optional notification to customer) |
| **Export** | Download appointments as CSV |

## Notifications

Configure automatic notifications from **Appointments → Settings → Notifications**:

- **Confirmation email** — sent immediately when booked
- **Reminder** — sent 24 hours or 1 hour before (configurable)
- **Cancellation** — sent when an appointment is cancelled

## Calendar Integration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Google Calendar">
    1. Go to **Appointments → Settings → Calendar Integration**
    2. Click **Connect Google Calendar**
    3. Sign in and grant access
    4. Select which calendar to sync with
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Outlook">
    1. Go to **Appointments → Settings → Calendar Integration**
    2. Click **Connect Outlook**
    3. Sign in with your Microsoft account
    4. Select your calendar
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>Calendar sync is two-way — appointments booked by Ringyo appear in your calendar, and busy slots from your calendar are blocked in Ringyo.</Tip>
