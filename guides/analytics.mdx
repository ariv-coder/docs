# Analytics

The Analytics page gives you a clear picture of how your AI agents are performing and how credits are being used.

## Accessing Analytics

Navigate to **Dashboard → Analytics** to see your data. Use the date picker to filter by time range (today, 7 days, 30 days, or custom).

## Overview Metrics

At the top of the analytics page, you'll see key numbers:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="Total Calls" icon="phone">
    Inbound and outbound calls handled
  </Card>
  <Card title="Total Chats" icon="message">
    Chat conversations completed
  </Card>
  <Card title="Appointments" icon="calendar">
    Bookings made by your agents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credits Used" icon="coins">

## Credit Usage

Track how your credits are being consumed:

- **Daily usage trend** — chart showing consumption over time
- **Remaining balance** — credits left in your current billing cycle

<Tip>Set up a **low credit alert** in **Settings → Notifications** to get notified when credits drop below a threshold.</Tip>

## Exporting Data

Click **Export** on any analytics view to download data as CSV. Available exports:

- Call logs with transcripts
- Chat conversation logs
- Appointment history
- Credit usage breakdown

<Info>Exports include all data for the selected date range, not just what's visible on screen.</Info>

## Agent-Level Analytics

Filter analytics by individual agent to compare performance across different agents. Use the **Agent** dropdown at the top of the analytics page.
