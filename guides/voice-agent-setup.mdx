# Voice Agent Setup

Your voice agent is the AI that handles calls and chats for your business. Here's how to create and configure one.

## Create an Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Agents">
    Navigate to **Dashboard → Agents** and click **Create Agent**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your agent">
    Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Front Desk Agent" or "Sales Assistant"). This is internal — callers won't see it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a voice">
    Select from available voice options. You can preview each voice before selecting. Options vary by accent, gender, and tone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the greeting">
    Write the first thing your agent says when answering a call:
    
    > "Hi, thanks for calling Acme Dental! I'm here to help with appointments, hours, or any questions. How can I help you today?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add instructions">
    Tell the agent how to behave. Be specific:
    - What services can it book?
    - What questions should it ask?
    - When should it transfer to a human?
    - What info should it collect?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and activate">
    Click **Save** to create the agent. Toggle it to **Active** to start receiving calls.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent Configuration

### Personality & Tone

Configure how your agent communicates:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Professional, friendly, casual, or formal |
| **Language** | Primary language for conversations |
| **Speed** | How fast the agent speaks |
| **Interruption handling** | Whether the agent pauses when the caller speaks |

### Instructions Best Practices

<Tip>Write instructions like you're training a new employee. Be clear about what the agent should and shouldn't do.</Tip>

Good instructions include:
- **Role:** "You are a receptionist for a dental clinic"
- **Tasks:** "Book appointments, answer FAQs, provide hours and directions"
- **Boundaries:** "Don't give medical advice. Transfer to a human if asked about pricing for complex procedures"
- **Data collection:** "Always ask for the caller's name and phone number before booking"

### Call Handling

Configure what happens in different scenarios:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Transfer Rules" icon="phone-arrow-right">
    Set conditions to transfer calls to a human (e.g., "transfer if caller asks for manager")
  </Card>
  <Card title="After-Hours" icon="moon">
    Custom message or voicemail when outside business hours
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fallback" icon="life-ring">
    What to do when the agent can't help (e.g., take a message, transfer)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Max Duration" icon="hourglass">
    Set a maximum call duration to manage credit usage
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Testing Your Agent

Before going live, test your agent:

1. Click **Test Call** on the agent page
2. Ringyo will call your phone so you can interact with the agent
3. Review the transcript and adjust instructions as needed

<Warning>Each test call uses credits from your balance (5 credits per minute).</Warning>
