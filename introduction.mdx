# Welcome to Ringyo AI

Ringyo AI is the easiest way to add AI-powered phone and chat capabilities to your business. Our platform enables you to create intelligent voice agents that can handle inbound calls, make outbound calls, book appointments, and integrate with your existing systems.

## What is Ringyo AI?

Ringyo AI is a complete platform for building and deploying AI phone agents. Think of it as having a 24/7 receptionist that:

- **Answers calls** in a natural, human-like voice
- **Books appointments** directly to your calendar
- **Qualifies leads** by asking the right questions
- **Handles FAQs** using your knowledge base
- **Transfers calls** to humans when needed
