## Overview

Connect your Google Calendar to Ringyo AI for seamless two-way appointment synchronization. When your AI agent books an appointment, it automatically appears in your calendar. Reschedules and cancellations sync instantly.

## Connecting Google Calendar

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Navigate to **Dashboard → Settings → Integrations**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Google">
    Click **Connect** next to Google Calendar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    Sign in with your Google account and grant Ringyo permission to manage calendar events
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Calendar">
    Choose which calendar to sync appointments with (you can select multiple)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use a dedicated calendar for Ringyo appointments to keep your personal events separate.
</Tip>

## How Sync Works

### Ringyo → Google Calendar

When your AI agent books, reschedules, or cancels an appointment:

| Action | Google Calendar Result |
|--------|----------------------|
| Appointment booked | New event created with customer details |
| Appointment rescheduled | Event time updated automatically |
| Appointment cancelled | Event deleted from calendar |
| Appointment confirmed | Event status updated |

### Google Calendar → Ringyo

Changes made directly in Google Calendar sync back:

| Action | Ringyo Result |
|--------|---------------|
| Event deleted | Appointment marked as cancelled |
| Event time changed | Appointment rescheduled |
| Event cancelled | Appointment cancelled, customer notified (if enabled) |

<Info>
  Two-way sync ensures your calendar is always the source of truth. Block time in Google Calendar and your AI agent will respect your availability.

## Event Details

Synced events include:

```

## Multiple Calendars

You can connect multiple Google accounts or calendars:

- **Per-agent calendars**: Assign different calendars to different agents
- **Team calendars**: Sync to a shared team calendar
- **Personal + Work**: Keep business appointments separate

Configure calendar routing in **Settings → Integrations → Google Calendar → Calendar Mapping**.

## Availability Sync

Your Google Calendar availability is automatically respected:

- Existing events block those time slots
- All-day events can optionally block the full day
- Buffer time between appointments is configurable
- Working hours from Google Calendar are honored

## Webhook Support

For advanced integrations, enable webhook notifications for calendar changes:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Google Calendar**
2. Enable **Webhook Notifications**
3. Configure your endpoint URL

Events sent:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `calendar.event_created` | New event added in Google Calendar |
| `calendar.event_updated` | Event modified |
| `calendar.event_deleted` | Event removed |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events not syncing">
    - Verify the integration is connected in Settings
    - Check that the correct calendar is selected
    - Ensure Ringyo has permission to manage events
    - Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Duplicate events">
    - This can happen if you manually create events. Let Ringyo handle appointment creation.
    - Check if you have multiple integrations connected to the same calendar
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong timezone">
    - Verify your timezone in **Settings → Business → Timezone**
    - Check your Google Calendar timezone settings match
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Availability not updating">
    - Sync happens every few minutes. Force a sync from Settings.
    - Ensure "Use calendar for availability" is enabled
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
