## Alternative: Webhooks

While waiting for native Zapier support, you can use [webhooks](/concepts/webhooks) with Zapier's webhook trigger to achieve similar functionality.

```javascript
// Zapier catches webhook from VoiceBook
// POST to your Zapier webhook URL
{
  "event": "call.completed",
  "call_id": "call_abc123",
  "duration": 245,
  "summary": "Customer inquired about pricing..."
}
```
